The Modular Implicits project is an extension of OCaml enabling ad-hoc polymorphism.
It was introduced in the paper [Modular Implicits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.01895) in 2014.

In the summer of 2023, Patrick Reader and Daniel Vlasits undertook a project to review the state of modular implicits,
and evaluate how suitable it would be for inclusion in the mainstream OCaml language. This website hosts [their report](/report.pdf).
